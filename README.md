## ✅ Summary

- **v1.0**: Simple and strong foundation, but vague on plugin rules, and slightly rigid commercial consent process.
- **v2.0**: Adds more clarity on plugin monetization and signature tiers, but the contributor structure becomes complex for large forks.
- **v3.0**: Refines everything — simpler contributor handling, plugin-friendly, modern wording, and clearly scoped monetization logic.
